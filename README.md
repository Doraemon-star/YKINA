YKINA (Your Kid Is Not Alone) is a secure platform designed to bridge the information gap for parents of children with rare pediatric diseases. To ensure that sensitive medical data is securely processed  at every stage, YKINA implemented AWS Nitro Enclave, which provides isolated environments, safeguarding the data even in the event of server kernel compromise. By integrating RSA encryption, it provides end-to-end protection and encrypts data in transmission and residence. This layered security model prevents unauthorized access and ensures compliance with stringent healthcare data regulations. With an intuitive React Native application backed by Strapi and AWS infrastructure, YKINA offers a scalable, user-friendly solution to empower parents, reduce stress, and foster a supportive community for families navigating rare pediatric diseases.
